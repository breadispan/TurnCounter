## Description
`TurnCounter` is an addon for **The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO)** designed to track and display the turn count in **Tales of Tribute** games. The addon shows a floating window that counts only the player's turns, and it changes the color of the text depending on the turn number. The window appears when the game starts and hides when the game ends.

## Features
- Displays a turn counter window in the middle of the screen.
- Counts only the player's turns, not the opponent's.
- Changes the color of the turn counter based on the current turn:
  - **White** for turns <= 10.
  - **Yellow** for turns >= 10 and < 20.
  - **Red** for turns >= 20.
- Automatically shows the counter when the game starts and hides it when the game ends.
- Can be used for both casual and competitive matches.

## Installation

1. Download the addon files.
2. Extract the files into the following directory in your ESO installation:
Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\AddOns\TurnCounter
3. Enable the addon in the ESO settings under **AddOns**.

## Usage

Once the addon is installed and enabled:
- The turn counter will appear at the start of each game.
- The counter will display only your turns (not the opponent's).
## To be added
- The color of the text will change based on the current turn:
- **White** for turns <= 10.
- **Yellow** for turns >= 10 and < 20.
- **Red** for turns >= 20.
- The counter will hide automatically when the game ends.

Currently, `TurnCounter` does not have customizable settings in the menu, but you can modify the colors and turn thresholds directly in the code if needed.
